# Space Travel Application

Welcome to the Space Travel Application!

## Features

- **Vue.js Frontend**: The frontend is built using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework. The user interface is designed for simplicity and ease of use, making space exploration an engaging experience.

- **Golang Backend**: The backend, powered by Golang, ensures robust server-side functionality. It handles data retrieval, processing, and communicates with the frontend to deliver dynamic content.

- **Caching Mechanism**: Recent requests are cached, optimizing performance by reducing redundant data fetching. This ensures a smooth and efficient user experience, especially for frequently accessed information.

- **SQLite Database**: The application uses SQLite as its database, providing a lightweight and easily deployable solution. The database seamlessly stores and retrieves relevant information for a streamlined user experience.
